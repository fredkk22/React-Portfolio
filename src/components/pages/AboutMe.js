        B.A. in Communication, Villanova University / Aug 2018 - Dec 2021
      </p>
      <p>
        At Villanova University, I studied several different courses within the Communication Department but chose to specialize in Media Production.
        Though I was initially accepted to the College of Engineering, a film course at the New York University School of Professional Studies I attended prior to college applications completely changed that decision.
        So, I transferred to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences before moving in and graduated with a Communication degree.

        However, I realized another passion of mine after graduating was in computer science.
        Therefore, I decided to apply to and was accepted to a coding bootcamp hosted remotely by the University of Pennsylvania!
        It is in its final days, and I plan to study further and apply for MERN fullstack, React developer, or any entry-level Javascript developer positions after graduating.
