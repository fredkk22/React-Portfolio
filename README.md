## Description

The Module 19 challenge was to create a single-page text editor application that meets the criteria of a PWA, allowing the user to install the application for offline use as well as saving text for access after editing while both online and offline.

The reason for creating a portfolio was to develop our skills and knowledge in PWA (Progressive Web Applications) and service workers further and to create our first web application that can be downloaded and accessed when offline.

I was able to learn more about and become more comfortable with PWAs, though I had some difficulty with service workers and needed guidance from my instructor.
